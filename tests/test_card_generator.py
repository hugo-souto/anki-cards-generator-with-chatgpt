# ChatGPT comments
# 
# In the setUp method, we initialize the AnkiCardGenerator with a GPT-4 model. 
# Then in the test_generate_card_returns_tuple method, we call generate_card 
# and assert that it returns a tuple. This is a very basic test, and your actual 
# tests will likely be more complex.
# 
# Remember, writing meaningful tests requires understanding what your code is 
# supposed to do and thinking about what might cause it to fail. You should 
# write tests to make sure that your code behaves as expected in a variety of 
# scenarios and edge cases. Also, this code assumes that the GPT-4 model object 
# is already initialized and can be passed directly to the AnkiCardGenerator. 
# You may need to modify this setup to suit your specific needs.
